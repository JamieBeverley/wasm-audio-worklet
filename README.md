# wasm-audio-worklet

Proof-of-concept (to-be-made-template) for creating Web Audio Worklets that run
DSP from WASM generated by Rust.
Rust -> WASM -> Audio Worklet -> threaded realtime audio in the browser

(with hopes that there may also be some performance gain in using WASM instead of
JS AudioWorklets but we'll see?)


- `./rust-wasm` contains a crate that defines a very basic audio `process` function
    - it just adds some noise to whatever the input signal is.
- `./` exports an async `initNode` function to set up an `AudioWorkletNode`:
    - loads the `wasm` binary
    - pipes it over to an AudioWorklet via a post message
    - creates an `AudioWorkletNode` and returns it
- `./demo` contains a `vanilla-ts` vite app for demonstration which:
    - imports `./`
    - sets up a button (user-interaction required to start audio context)
    - when that button clicks, plays an oscillator and connects it to the
      Wasm-based AudioWorkletNode
      (so it plays a sin osc w/ some noise added... `tadaa`)
