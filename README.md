# wasm-audio-worklet

Template Repo for creating for creating Web Audio Worklets that run DSP from
WASM generated by Rust.

Rust -> WASM -> Audio Worklet -> threaded realtime audio in the browser

Note: this was previously a Proof-of-Concept repo more for demo purposes - it is
starting to grow into more of an actual library/collection of Audio Worklet
tools.

As those tools grow in complexity, the utility of this repo as a demo/learning
resource as originally intended may decline.

A snapshot of a somewhat minimal-working example with more code comments is
available at the `mvp` git tag.

## Directory Map

- `./`:
    - the root of the project is an npm module that is intended to be a portable
      rust/wasm AudioWorkletNode
    - Intended to be a simple npm install for other JS projects to import this
      module so the wasm + worklet are bundled too
    - presently it exposes AudioWorkletNode[s]
    - `public/<...>.wasm` and `public/worklet.js` get bundled as well as
      they must be loaded statically
    - The AudioNode gets reference to their paths via `URL(...).href`
- `./crates` - a cargo workspace of several crates that we compile to wasm to
    perform DSP. These use share a `./crates/common` crate for shared utilities
    - built via `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` (notably not with
      `wasm-pack`)
- `./demo`
    - a small vite vanilla-ts page for testing things

## Things Tried + Resources

- Started here:
    - https://dev.to/speratus/i-built-this-despite-a-flaw-in-rusts-webassembly-toolchain-38p2
        - this repo is more akin to part 2 of this blog
        - I chose to avoid wasm-pack/wasm-bindgen (part 3) because:
            - it either involves mutating some of the JS bindings generated by
            wasm-pack (prone to breaking, this is not a public interface)
            - or poly-filling some things in the AudioWorklet environment/context
            so wasm-pack bindings don't error-out when `init`/`initSync` is called
            (I'm not sure what would be involved in polyfilling all this but it
            felt like potentially a lot or possibly infeasible. e.g. fetch API is
            not accessible to AudioWorklets)
        - This blog didn't get me the full way however: example here uses a wasm
        function call _per-sample_ but I wanted/needed rust/wasm processing full
        audio blocks.
        - This requires some more convoluted memory management (so we can pass
        references to Float32Arrays between WASM and JS)
- This was also helpful: https://www.toptal.com/webassembly/webassembly-rust-tutorial-web-audio
    - However, this particular example doesn't produce audio from the wasm 
      process fn (its doing pitch detection).
    - Wanted something that was mutating the `output` (so we can generate/modify
      the signal)
- This example from the `wasm-bindgen` book examples was helpful too: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/wasm-audio-worklet.html
  - but [it depends on unstable cargo features](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/main/examples/wasm-audio-worklet/build.py#L10-L11)
- Ultimately found: https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/wasm-loop-player/tree/master
  - which was exactly what I needed (and does more cool stuff - sample playback
    from wasm)
  - A more full example from the same person: https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/ruffbox
  - Both insipred by: [this repo](https://github.com/reprimande/wasm-audioworklet-synth) and [this blog](https://qiita.com/reprimande/items/5c078e5a7f9f52d2091c)
